# hello-world

Hello there,

As I get better with programming, I'd love to help make this earth a better place for everyone. We're only here for a short amount of time, so we might as well make it a fun, interesting and fulfilling experience. 
I'm fairly new to programming and there is no better or exciting time in history to be part of this revolution. 
If anybody has any pointers or suggestions, I welcome them!

David
